# my-first-project.
My project- "TruthFinder: A Machine Learning Approach to Fake News Detection". This is my first project on GitHub. Excited to delve into the world of coding and collaboration, this project aims to [to classify fake news from real news using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).]. Join me on this learning journey, and let's build something great together!"
